Appliance ?
-----------

An appliance is a ready to use image of an operating system including
a preconfigured application for a specific use case. The appliance is
provided as an image file and needs to be deployed to, or activated in
the target system or service.

In KIWI the appliance is specified by a collection of human readable files
in a directory, also called as the `image description`. At least one XML
file :file:`config.xml` or :file:`.kiwi` is required. In addition
there may be as well other files like scripts or configuration data.
