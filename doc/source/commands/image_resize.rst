=================

SYNOPSIS
--------

.. code:: bash

   kiwi [global options] service <command> [<args>]

   kiwi image resize -h | --help
   kiwi image resize --target-dir=<directory> --size=<size>
       [--root=<directory>]
   kiwi image resize help

DESCRIPTION
-----------

For disk based images, allow to resize the image to a new disk geometry.
The additional space is free and not in use by the image. In order to
make use of the additional free space a repartition process is required
like it is provided by kiwi's oem boot code. Therefore the resize operation
is useful for oem image builds most of the time.

OPTIONS
-------

--root=<directory>

  The path to the root directory, if not specified kiwi
  searches the root directory in build/image-root below
  the specified target directory

--size=<size>

  New size of the image. The value is either a size in bytes
  or can be specified with m=MB or g=GB. Example: 20g

--target-dir=<directory>

  Directory containing the kiwi build results
