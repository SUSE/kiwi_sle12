SYNOPSIS
--------

   kiwi [global options] service <command> [<args>]

   kiwi image info -h | --help
   kiwi image info --description=<directory>

   kiwi image info help

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Provides information about the specified image description.
If no specific info option is provided the command just
lists basic information about the image which could also be
directly obtained by reading the image XML description file.
Specifying an extension option like `resolve-package-list`
will cause a dependency resolver to run over the list of
packages and thus provides more detailed information about
the image description.


OPTIONS
-------

--add-repo=<source,type,alias,priority>

  Add repository with given source, type, alias and priority.

--description=<directory>

  The description must be a directory containing a kiwi XML
  description and optional metadata files.

--ignore-repos

  Ignore all repository configurations from the XML description.
  Using that option is usally done with a sequence of --add-repo
  options otherwise there are no repositories available for the
  processing the requested image information which could lead
  to an error.

--resolve-package-list

  Solve package dependencies and return a list of all
  packages including their attributes e.g size,
  shasum, and more.
